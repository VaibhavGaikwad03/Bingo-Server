1. Server-Side Implementation
- The server will be developed using C++.
- It will utilize the uWebSocket library to manage WebSocket connections efficiently.
- The server will handle multiple concurrent client connections using asynchronous I/O.
- It will manage user sessions, maintain connection states, and route messages appropriately.

2. Client-Side Platform
- The client will be web-based, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- It will connect to the C++ server using WebSocket.
- The UI will support sending and receiving real-time chat messages.
- Optionally, support for features like message timestamps, typing indicators, and message history display can be added.

3. Communication Protocol
- The protocol used for communication between the client and the server will be WebSocket, which allows for low-latency, full-duplex communication.
- WebSocket connection lifecycle will be managed by the server (onOpen, onMessage, onClose).

4. Message Format
- Messages will be exchanged in JSON format to ensure easy parsing and structured data exchange.
- A typical message might contain:

json
{
    "type": "message",
    "sender": "Vaibhav",
    "receiver": "Rituja",
    "content": "Hello, world!",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-04T19:00:00Z"
}

5. JSON Parsing
- On the server side, JSON messages will be parsed using the nlohmann/json library.
- On the client side, the browsers native JSON methods (JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()) will be used.

6. Build System
- The server will use CMake as the build system to manage project dependencies, compiler settings, and build configurations.

7. Local to Internet Access (Development)
- During development and testing, Ngrok will be used to expose the local server to the internet securely via HTTPS.
- This allows real-time testing on remote devices and sharing with collaborators.

8. Error Handling & Validation
- The server will validate incoming JSON messages to ensure correct format and required fields.
- Proper error handling will be implemented to handle unexpected disconnects, malformed messages, and protocol violations.

9. Security Considerations
- WebSocket connections will be secured using WSS (WebSocket over TLS) in production.
- Input validation will be done to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
- User authentication (optional for future versions) can be added using token-based systems (e.g., JWT).

10. Logging and Monitoring
- Basic logging will be implemented on the server side to track user connections, disconnections, and message flow.
- This can later be extended for analytics or debugging.

11. Scalability and Extensibility
- The architecture will allow future features like:
- Private messaging
- Chat rooms / channels
- User authentication and profiles
- Message persistence using a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- File or image sharing

12. Development and Deployment
- Initially, the application will be run locally for testing.
